abstract = {Introduction: Young women aged 15 to 24 years in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. A growing number of studies have suggested that the practice of transactional sex may in part explain women's heightened risk, but evidence on the association between transactional sex and HIV has not yet been synthesized. We set out to systematically review studies that assess the relationship between transactional sex and HIV among men and women in sub-Saharan Africa and to summarize the findings through a meta-analysis. Methods: The search strategy included 8 databases, hand searches in 10 journals, and searches across 17 websites and portals for organizations as informed by expert colleagues. A systematic review of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies was carried out for studies on women and men who engage in transactional sex published up through 2014. Random effects meta-analysis was used to further examine the relationship between transactional sex and prevalent HIV infection across a subset of studies with the same exposure period. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women. Results: Nineteen papers from 16 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these 16 studies, 14 provided data on women and 10 on men. We find a significant, positive, unadjusted or adjusted association between transactional sex and HIV in 10 of 14 studies for women, one of which used a longitudinal design (relative risk (RR)=2.06, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.22 -3.48). Out of 10 studies involving men, only 2 indicate a positive association between HIV and transactional sex in unadjusted or adjusted models. The meta-analysis confirmed general findings from the systematic review (unadjusted meta-analysis findings are significant for women (n=4; pooled odds ratio (OR)=1.54, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-2.28; I2=42.5{\%}, p=0.156), but not for men (n=4; pooled OR=1.47, 95{\%} CI: 0.85-2.56; I2=50.8{\%}, p=0.107). Conclusions: Transactional sex is associated with HIV among women, whereas findings for men were inconclusive. Given that only two studies used a longitudinal approach, there remains a need for better measurement of the practice of transactional sex and additional longitudinal studies to establish the causal pathways between transactional sex and HIV.},

The large amount of information on the distribution of HIV infections in San Francisco's gay community suggests the opposite approach-estimating the incubation distribution, assuming known infection and diagnosis distributions.

Very limited information is available about the probability of transmission during acute HIV infection. We conducted a secondary analysis of published data from the Rakai, Uganda seroconversion study. Mathematical and computer-based models were used to quantify the per-act and per-partnership transmission probabilities during acute and chronic HIV infection, and to estimate how many of the transmission events reported in the Rakai study were due to acute-phase HIV transmission. The average per-act transmission probability during acute infection equaled 0.03604 vs. 0.00084 for chronic HIV infection. Overall, HIV was transmitted during acute infection in 46.5{\%} of 23 "incident index partner couples." Acute-phase transmission accounted for 89.1{\%} of all transmission events in the first 20 months of follow-up. These results highlight the substantial risk of transmission during acute HIV infection. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Fiebig2003,
abstract = {Objectives: The characterization of primary HIV infection by the analysis of serial plasma samples from newly infected persons using multiple standard viral assays. Design: A retrospective study involving two sets of archived samples from HIV-infected plasma donors. (A) 435 samples from 51 donors detected by anti-HIV enzyme immunoassays donated during 1984-1994; (B) 145 specimens from 44 donors detected by p24 antigen screening donated during 1996-1998. Setting: Two US plasma products companies. Main outcome measures: The timepoints of appearance of HIV-1 markers and viral load concentrations during primary HIV infection. Results: The pattern of sequential emergence of viral markers in the 'A' panels was highly consistent, allowing the definition and estimation of the duration of six sequential stages. From the 'B' panels, the viral load at p24 antigen seroconversion was estimated by regression analysis at 10 000 copies/ml (95{\%} CI 2000-93 000) and the HIV replication rate at 0.35 log copies/ml/day, corresponding to a doubling time in the preseroconversion phase of 20.5 h (95{\%} CI 18.2-23.4 h). Consequently, an RNA test with 50 copies/ml sensitivity would detect HIV infection approximately 7 days before a p24 antigen test, and 12 days before a sensitive anti-HIV test. Conclusion: The sequential emergence of assay reactivity allows the classification of primary HIV-1 infection into distinct laboratory stages, which may facilitate the diagnosis of recent infection and stratification of patients enrolled in clinical trials. Quantitative analysis of preseroconversion replication rates of HIV is useful for projecting the yield and predictive value of assays targeting primary HIV infection. {\textcopyright} 2003 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

@article{Britton2020,
abstract = {In response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), some politicians have been keen to exploit the idea of achieving herd immunity. Countering this possibility are estimates derived from work on historical vaccination studies, which suggest that herd immunity may only be achieved at an unacceptable cost of lives. Because human populations are far from homogeneous, Britton et al. show that by introducing age and activity heterogeneities into population models for SARS-CoV-2, herd immunity can be achieved at a population-wide infection rate of {\~{}}40{\%}, considerably lower than previous estimates. This shift is because transmission and immunity are concentrated among the most active members of a population, who are often younger and less vulnerable. If nonpharmaceutical interventions are very strict, no herd immunity is achieved, and infections will then resurge if they are eased too quickly.Science, this issue p. 846Despite various levels of preventive measures, in 2020, many countries have suffered severely from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Using a model, we show that population heterogeneity can affect disease-induced immunity considerably because the proportion of infected individuals in groups with the highest contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. We estimate that if R0 = 2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity, then the disease-induced herd immunity level can be {\~{}}43{\%}, which is substantially less than the classical herd immunity level of 60{\%} obtained through homogeneous immunization of the population. Our estimates should be interpreted as an illustration of how population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather than as an exact value or even a best estimate.},

@article{Nsubuga2014,
abstract = {Background: The basic reproduction number, R0, is one of the many measures of the epidemic potential of an infection in a population. We estimate HIV R0 over 18 years in a rural population in Uganda, examine method-specific differences in estimated R0, and estimate behavioural changes that would reduce R0 below one. Methods: Data on HIV natural history and infectiousness were collated from literature. Data on new sexual partner count were available from a rural clinical cohort in Uganda over 1991-2008. R0 was estimated using six methods. Behavioural changes required to reduce R0 below one were calculated. Results: Reported number of new partners per year was 0 to 16 (women) and 0 to 80 (men). When proportionate sexual mixing was assumed, the different methods yielded comparable R0 estimates. Assuming totally assortative mixing led to increased R0 estimates in the high sexual activity class while all estimates in the low-activity class were below one. Using the "effective" partner change rate introduced by Anderson and colleagues resulted in R0 estimates all above one except in the lowest sexual activity class. R0 could be reduced below one if: (a) medium risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 70{\%} and higher risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 93{\%}, or (b) higher risk individuals reduce the partner acquisition rate by 95{\%}. Conclusions: The estimated R0 depended strongly on the method used. Ignoring variation in sexual activity leads to an underestimation of R0. Relying on behaviour change alone to eradicate HIV may require unrealistically large reductions in risk behaviour, even though for a small proportion of the population. To control HIV, complementary prevention strategies such as male circumcision and HIV treatment services need rapid scale up. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nsubuga et al.},

The behaviour of these models is greatly affected by the way in which transmission between infected and susceptible hosts is modelled.

Equilibrium points and the basic reproduction number are derived. The basic reproduction number provides a threshold that determines whether or not the disease fades away. The model, described by non-linear ODEs, shows existence of unique disease-free and disease-persistent equilibria. Least squares curve fitting is presented to quantitatively investigate the trend of infection within each gender. The results are indicative of a higher infectivity in the female population. We further investigated the effect of the introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on the dynamics of the HIV. Our results show that the introduction of PrEP has had a positive effect on the limitation of spread of HIV. Sensitivity analysis results show that control of effective contacts can result in control of the disease across gender divide. The model provides a unique opportunity to influence policy on HIV treatment and management.},

In the present manuscript, we formulate and analyze a mathematical compartmental models of HIV transmission within and between two age groups in Kenya. We fitted the model to data using MCMC technique and inferred the parameters. We also estimate the reproduction numbers, namely within age group transmission and between age groups transmission basic reproduction numbers. The analysis of the data revealed that there is significant difference in mean number of new HIV infections between males and females within the two age groups. More, particularly, females are highly infected with HIV as compared to their male counterparts. Calculation of the reproduction numbers within and between age groups provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply from observations on the prevalence of infection. More specifically, the analysis showed that the per capita rate of HIV transmission was highest when there is interaction between young adults to adults and most HIV infections occurred in adult population. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the reproduction numbers depend mainly on the probabilities of infection. This results can be used to guide HIV interventions, condom distribution and antiretroviral therapy. Precisely, the results can be used to educate the young adults on practicing safe sex with their partners in order to contain the occurrence of new infections.},

In a simplified model, when no ART treatment is implemented, disease-free and the endemic equilibrium points were established analytically along with the basic reproduction number. The local stability criteria of disease-free equilibrium and the existing criteria of endemic equilibrium were analyzed. We find that endemic equilibrium exists when the basic reproduction number is larger than one. From the sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number of the complete model (with ART treatment), we find that the increased number of infected humans who follow the ART treatment program will reduce the basic reproduction number. We simulate this result also in the numerical experiment of the autonomous system to show how treatment intervention impacts the reduction of the infected population during the intervention time period.},

METHODS: One thousand and sixty-six consecutive symptomatic women were interviewed and examined; bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis (TV), cervical infection (CI) due to chlamydial or gonococcal infections, and syphilis seroreactivity were determined by laboratory diagnosis. Associations between STIs and individual characteristics were evaluated using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of BV, TV, CI, and syphilis seroreactivity was, respectively, 85{\%}, 16{\%}, 49{\%}, 16{\%} in 94 prostitutes; 70{\%}, 18{\%}, 30{\%}, 13{\%} in 96 occasional sex traders; and 53{\%}, 24{\%}, 17{\%}, and 4{\%} in 876 general women. CI was independently and positively associated with a symptomatic partner, new sex partner in last 3 months, unfaithful partner, prostitution, joblessness and being {\textless} 25 years old. Syphilis was associated with low schooling, young age at coital debut, sex trading, and {\textgreater} 1 sex partner in the previous 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: These high STI rates and associated characteristics suggest the local vulnerability to rapid HIV spread and show the need for prevention efforts that involve youth, prostitutes, occasional sex traders, sex clients, and men who have concurrent sexual partnerships.},

abstract = {HIV-1 transmission occurs in a limited number of ways all of which are preventable. Overall, the risk of HIV-1 transmission following a single sexual exposure is low especially in comparison with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs); with estimates of the average probability of male to female HIV-1 transmission only 0.0005-0.0026 per coital act. The risk of acquiring HIV-1 from a single contact varies enormously and is dependant upon the infectiousness of the HIV-1 positive individual and the susceptibility to HIV-1 of their sexual partner. An understanding of the determinants of HIV-1 transmission is important not only to assess the infection risk to an individual when exposed to the virus (e.g. to determine the provision of post exposure prophylaxis), but also to make accurate predictions on the potential spread of HIV-1 infection in a population and to direct appropriate targeted prevention strategies. In this review article we summarise the current literature on the major worldwide source of HIV-1 acquisition, sexual transmission.

@article{Steen2015,
abstract = {Background and Overview. High rates of partner change in sex work-whether in professional, 'transactional' or other context-disproportionately drive transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Several countries in Asia have demonstrated that reducing transmission in sex work can reverse established epidemics among sex workers, their clients and the general population. Experience and emerging research from Africa reaffirms unprotected sex work to be a key driver of sexual transmission in different contexts and regardless of stage or classification of HIV epidemic. This validation of the epidemiology behind sexual transmission carries an urgent imperative to realign prevention resources and scale up effective targeted interventions in sex work settings, and, given declining HIV resources, to do so efficiently. Eighteen articles in this issue highlight the importance and feasibility of such interventions under four themes: 1) epidemiology, data needs and modelling of sex work in generalised epidemics; 2) implementation science addressing practical aspects of intervention scaleup; 3) community mobilisation and 4) the treatment cascade for sex workers living with HIV. Conclusion. Decades of empirical evidence, extended by analyses in this collection, argue that protecting sex work is, without exception, feasible and necessary for controlling HIV/STI epidemics. In addition, the disproportionate burden of HIV borne by sex workers calls for facilitated access to ART, care and support. The imperative for Africa is rapid scale-up of targeted prevention and treatment, facilitated by policies and action to improve conditions where sex work takes place. The opportunity is a wealth of accumulated experience working with sex workers in diverse settings, which can be tapped to make up for lost time. Elsewhere, even in countries with strong interventions and services for sex workers, an emerging challenge is to find ways to sustain them in the face of declining global resources.},

abstract = {Background: The probability of HIV-1 transmission per coital act in representative African populations is unknown. We aimed to calculate this probability overall, and to estimate how it is affected by various factors thought to influence infectivity. Methods: 174 monogamous couples, in which one partner was HIV-1 positive, were retrospectively identified from a population cohort in Rakai, Uganda. Frequency of intercourse and reliability of reporting within couples was assessed prospectively. HIV-1 seroconversion was determined in the uninfected partners, and HIV-1 viral load was measured in the infected partners. Adjusted rate ratios of transmission per coital act were estimated by Poisson regression. Probabilities of transmission per act were estimated by log-log binomial regression for quartiles of age and HIV-1 viral load, and for symptoms or diagnoses of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the HIV-1-infected partners. Results: The mean frequency of intercourse was 8.9 per month, which declined with age and HIV-1 viral load. Members of couples reported similar frequencies of intercourse. The overall unadjusted probability of HIV-1 transmission per coital act was 0.0011 (95{\%} CI 0.0008-0.0015). Transmission probabilities increased from 0.0001 per act at viral loads of less than 1700 copies/mL to 0.0023 per act at 38 500 copies/mL or more (p=0.002), and were 0.0041 with genital ulceration versus 0.0011 without (p=0.02). Transmission probabilities per act did not differ significantly by HIV-1 subtypes A and D, sex, STDs, or symptoms of discharge or dysuria in the HIV-1-positive partner. Interpretation: Higher viral load and genital ulceration are the main determinants of HIV-1 transmission per coital act in this Ugandan population.},

Design A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted. Setting Participants were randomly selected using a two-stage random sampling method in uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between June 2014 and June 2015. Participants A total of 1306 15-24-year-old women in an ongoing heterosexual partnership were included in the analysis. Participants had to be a resident in the area for 12 months, and able to provide informed consent and speak one of the local languages (Zulu or English). Primary and secondary outcome measures Sexual frequency was assessed by asking participants how many times they had sex with each partner in the past 12 months. The degree of condomless sex within partnerships was assessed in the survey by asking participants how often they used a condom with their partners. Results Age-disparate partnerships were associated with a higher order category (once, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, {\textgreater}20) of coital frequency (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.32, p{\textless}0.05, 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 1.71) and with sex on more than 10 occasions (aOR 1.48, p{\textless}0.01, 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 1.96) compared with age-similar partnerships.

abstract = {Background: Age-disparate partnerships are hypothesized to increase HIV-risk for young women. However, the evidence base remains mixed. Most studies have focused only on unprotected sex among women in the partnership. Consequently, little is known about other risky behaviours, such as transactional sex, alcohol use, and concurrency, as well as the behaviours of the men who partner with young women. We therefore examined differences in various sexual behaviours of both young women and their male partners by partnership age difference. Methods: We used nationally representative data from South Africa (2012) on partnerships reported by 16-24 year old black African women (n = 818) and by black African men in partnerships with 16-24 year old women (n = 985).We compared sexual behaviours in age-disparate partnerships and age-similar partnerships, using multiple logistic regression to control for potential confounders and to assess rural/urban differences. Results: Young women in age-disparate partnerships were more likely to report unprotected sex than young women in similar-aged partnerships (aOR:1.51; p = 0.014; 95{\%}CI:1.09-2.11). Men in partnerships with young women were more likely to report unprotected sex (aOR:1.92; p{\textless}0.01; 95{\%}CI:1.31-2.81), transactional sex (aOR:2.73; p{\textless}0.01; 95{\%}CI:1.64-4.56), drinking alcohol before sex (aOR:1.60; p = 0.062; 95{\%}CI:0.98-2.61), and concurrency (aOR:1.39; p = 0.097; 95{\%}CI:0.94-2.07) when their partners were five or more years younger. The association between age-disparate partnerships and transactional sex (aOR:4.14; p{\textless}0.01; 95{\%}CI: 2.03-8.46) and alcohol use (aOR:2.24; p{\textless}0.013; 95{\%}CI:1.20-4.19) was only found in urban areas. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that young women's age-disparate partnerships involve greater sexual risk, particularly through the risky behaviours of their male partners, with the risk amplified for young women in urban areas.},

We use dynamic exponential random graph models to estimate partnership network parameters from an empirical study of sexual behavior and drive a stochastic simulation of HIV transmission through this dynamic network. Our simulated networks match observed frequencies and durations of short- and long-term partnerships, with concurrency patterns specific to gender and partnership type. Our findings suggest that, at current behavior levels, the epidemic cannot be sustained in this population without both concurrency and acute infection; removing either brings transmission below the threshold for persistence. With both present, we estimate 20-25{\%} of transmissions stem from acute-stage infections, 30-50{\%} from chronic-stage, and 30-45{\%} from AIDS-stage. The impact of acute infection is strongly moderated by concurrency. Reducing this impact by reducing concurrency could potentially end the current HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Global trends in HIV incidence are estimated typically by serial prevalence surveys in selected sentinel populations or less often in representative population samples. Incidence estimates are often modeled because cohorts are costly to maintain and are rarely representative of larger populations. From global trends, we can see reason for cautious optimism. Downward trends in generalized epidemics in Africa, concentrated epidemics in persons who inject drugs (PWID), some female sex worker cohorts, and among older men who have sex with men (MSM) have been noted. However, younger MSM and those from minority populations, as with black MSM in the United States, show continued transmission at high rates. Among the many HIV prevention strategies, current efforts to expand testing, linkage to effective care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy are known as "treatment as prevention" (TasP). A concept first forged for the prevention of mother to child transmission, TasP generates high hopes that persons treated early will derive considerable clinical benefits and that lower infectiousness will reduce transmission in communities. With the global successes of risk reduction for PWID, we have learned that reducing marginalization of the at-risk population, implementation of nonjudgmental and pragmatic sterile needle and syringe exchange programs, and offering of opiate substitution therapy to help persons eschew needle use altogether can work to reduce the HIV epidemic. Never has the urgency of stigma reduction and guarantees of human rights been more urgent; a public health approach to at-risk populations requires that to avail themselves of prevention services and they must feel welcomed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract = {The precise identification of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) responsible for productive clinical infection could be instrumental in elucidating the molecular basis of HIV-1 transmission and in designing effective vaccines. Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

abstract = {Introduction: The unchanged global HIV incidence may be related to ignoring acute HIV infection (AHI). This scoping review examines diagnostic, clinical, and public health implications of identifying and treating persons with AHI. Methods: We searched PubMed, in addition to hand-review of key journals identifying research pertaining to AHI detection and treatment. We focused on the relative contribution of AHI to transmission and the diagnostic, clinical, and public health implications. We prioritized research from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) published in the last fifteen years. Results and Discussion: Extensive AHI research and limited routine AHI detection and treatment have begun in LMIC. Diagnostic challenges include ease-of-use, suitability for application and distribution in LMIC, and throughput for high-volume testing. Risk score algorithms have been used in LMIC to screen for AHI among individuals with behavioural and clinical characteristics more often associated with AHI. However, algorithms have not been implemented outside research settings. From a clinical perspective, there are substantial immunological and virological benefits to identifying and treating persons with AHI - evading the irreversible damage to host immune systems and seeding of viral reservoirs that occurs during untreated acute infection. The therapeutic benefits require rapid initiation of antiretrovirals, a logistical challenge in the absence of point-of-care testing. From a public health perspective, AHI diagnosis and treatment is critical to: decrease transmission via viral load reduction and behavioural interventions; improve pre-exposure prophylaxis outcomes by avoiding treatment initiation for HIV-seronegative persons with AHI; and, enhance partner services via notification for persons recently exposed or likely transmitting. Conclusions: There are undeniable clinical and public health benefits to AHI detection and treatment, but also substantial diagnostic and logistical barriers to implementation and scale-up. Effective early ART initiation may be critical for HIV eradication efforts, but widespread use in LMIC requires simple and accurate diagnostic tools. Implementation research is critical to facilitate sustainable integration of AHI detection and treatment into existing health systems and will be essential for prospective evaluation of testing algorithms, point-of-care diagnostics, and efficacious and effective first-line regimens.},

abstract = {Background Multiple prevention measures have the possibility of impacting HIV incidence in South Korea, including early diagnosis, early treatment, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We investigated how each of these interventions could impact the local HIV epidemic, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM), who have become the major risk group in South Korea. A mathematical model was used to estimate the effects of each these interventions on the HIV epidemic in South Korea over the next 40 years, as compared to the current situation. Methods We constructed a mathematical model of HIV infection among MSM in South Korea, dividing the MSM population into seven groups, and simulated the effects of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), early diagnosis, PrEP, and combination interventions on the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection, as compared to the current situation that would be expected without any new prevention measures. Results Overall, the model suggested that the most effective prevention measure would be PrEP. Even though PrEP effectiveness could be lessened by increased unsafe sex behavior, PrEP use was still more beneficial than the current situation. In the model, early diagnosis of HIV infection was also effectively decreased HIV incidence. However, early ART did not show considerable effectiveness. As expected, it would be most effective if all interventions (PrEP, early diagnosis and early treatment) were implemented together. Conclusions This model suggests that PrEP and early diagnosis could be a very effective way to reduce HIV incidence in South Korea among MSM.},

abstract = {Background: Most model analyses examining the role of primary HIV infection in the HIV epidemic ignore the fact that HIV is often transmitted through long-term, concurrent sexual partnerships. We sought to understand how duration and concurrency of sexual partnerships affect the role of transmissions during primary HIV infection. Methods: We constructed a stochastic individual-based model of HIV transmission in a homogeneous population where partnerships form and dissolve. Using observed contagiousness by stage of HIV infection, the fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection at equilibrium was examined across varying partnership durations and concurrencies. Results: The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection has a U-shaped relationship with partnership duration. The fraction drops with increasing partnership duration for partnerships with shorter average duration but rises for partnerships with longer average duration. Partnership concurrency modifies this relationship. The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection increases with increasing partnership concurrency for partnerships with shorter average duration, but decreases for partnerships with longer average duration. Conclusions: Partnership patterns strongly influence the transmission of HIV and do so differentially by stage of infection. Dynamic partnerships need to be taken into account to make a robust inference on the role of different stages of HIV infection. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Background. We estimated rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission per coital act in HIV-discordant couples by stage of infection in the index partner. Methods. We retrospectively identified 235 monogamous, HIV-discordant couples in a Ugandan population-based cohort. HIV transmission within pairs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Rates of transmission per coital act were estimated by the index partner's stage of infection (recent seroconversion or prevalent or late-stage infection). The adjusted rate ratio of transmission per coital act was estimated by multivariate Poisson regression. Results. The average rate of HIV transmission was 0.0082/coital act (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.0039-0.0150) within â¼2.5 months after seroconversion of the index partner; 0.0015/coital act within 6-15 months after seroconversion of the index partner (95{\%} CI, 0.0002-0.0055); 0.0007/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0005-0.0010) among HIV-prevalent index partners; and 0.0028/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0015-0.0041) 6-25 months before the death of the index partner. In adjusted models, early- and late-stage infection, higher HIV load, genital ulcer disease, and younger age of the index partner were significantly associated with higher rates of transmission. Conclusions. The rate of HIV transmission per coital act was highest during early-stage infection. This has implications for HIV prevention and for projecting the effects of antiretroviral treatment on HIV transmission. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

abstract = {HIV/AIDS prevalence rates across countries of the world vary more than 500-fold from .06{\%} in Hungary to 33.4{\%} in Swaziland. One of the most cited research papers in the field, utilizing cross country regression analysis to analyze other correlates with this HIV prevalence data, is flawed in that it weights each country's results by the country's population. Based on cross-country linear and multiple regressions using newly gathered data from UNAIDS, the number of female commercial sex workers as a percentage of the female adult population is robustly positively correlated with countrywide HIV/AIDS prevalence levels. Confirming earlier studies, female illiteracy levels, gender illiteracy differences and income inequality within countries are also significantly positively correlated with HIV/AIDS levels. Muslims as a percentage of the population, itself highly correlated with country circumcision rates and previously found to be negatively correlated with HIV/AIDS prevalence, is insignificant when the percentage of commercial sex workers in a population is included in the analysis. This paper provides strong evidence that when conducted properly, cross country regression data does not support the theory that male circumcision is the key to slowing the AIDS epidemic. Rather, it is the number of infected prostitutes in a country that is highly significant and robust in explaining HIV prevalence levels across countries. An explanation is offered for why Africa has been hit the hardest by the AIDS pandemic and why there appears to be very little correlation between HIV/AIDS infection rates and country wealth.},

@article{Mah2011,
abstract = {Multiple sexual partnerships must necessarily lie at the root of a sexually transmitted epidemic. However, that overlapping or concurrent partnerships have played a pivotal role in the generalized epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa has been challenged. Much of the original proposition that concurrent partnerships play such a role focused on modelling, self-reported sexual behaviour data and ethnographic data. While each of these has definite merit, each also has had methodological limitations. Actually, more recent cross-national sexual behaviour data and improved modelling have strengthened these lines of evidence. However, heretofore the epidemiologic evidence has not been systematically brought to bear. Though assessing the epidemiologic evidence regarding concurrency has its challenges, a careful examination, especially of those studies that have assessed HIV incidence, clearly indicates a key role for concurrency. Such evidence includes: 1) the early and dramatic rise of HIV infection in generalized epidemics that can only arise from transmission through rapid sequential acute infections and thereby concurrency; 2) clear evidence from incidence studies that a major portion of transmission in the population occurs via concurrency both for concordant negative and discordant couples; 3) elevation in risk associated with partner's multiple partnering; 4) declines in HIV associated with declines in concurrency; 5) bursts and clustering of incident infections that indicate concurrency and acute infection play a key role in the propagation of epidemics; and 6) a lack of other plausible explanations, including serial monogamy and non-sexual transmission. While other factors, such as sexually transmitted infections, other infectious diseases, biological factors and HIV sub-type, likely play a role in enhancing transmission, it appears most plausible that these would amplify the role of concurrency rather than alter it. Additionally, critics of concurrency have not proposed plausible alternative explanations for why the explosive generalized epidemics occurred. Specific behaviour change messaging bringing the concepts of multiple partnering and concurrency together appears salient and valid in promoting safer individual behaviour and positive social norms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Mah and Shelton; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The combination of long-term concurrent sexual partnerships and high infectiousness early in HIV infection has been suggested as a key driver of the extensive spread of HIV in general populations in sub-Saharan Africa, but this has never been scientifically investigated. We use a mathematical model to simulate HIV spreading on sexual networks with different amounts of concurrency. The models show that if HIV infectiousness is constant over the duration of infection, the amount of concurrency has much less influence on HIV spread compared to when infectiousness varies over three stages of infection with high infectiousness in the first months. The proportion of transmissions during primary infection is sensitive to the amount of concurrency and, in this model, is estimated to be between 16 and 28{\%} in spreading epidemics with increasing concurrency. The sensitivity of epidemic spread to the amount of concurrency is greater than predicted by models that do not include primary HIV infection. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Early estimates of the transmission potential of emerging and re-emerging infections are increasingly used to inform public health authorities on the level of risk posed by outbreaks. Existingmethods to estimate the reproduction number generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few disease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in. In reality, outbreaks can display subexponential (i.e. polynomial) growth in the first few disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behaviour changes or other mechanisms. Here, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early growth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number, with no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth.We demonstrate this phenomenological approach using analytical results and simulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of empirical disease datasets. Our results suggest that subexponential growth in the early phase of an epidemic is the rule rather the exception. Mechanistic simulations show that slight modifications to the classical susceptible-infectious-removed model result in subexponential growth, and in turn a rapid decline in the reproduction number within three to five disease generations. For empirical outbreaks, the generalized-growth model consistently outperforms the exponential model for a variety of directlyand indirectly transmitted diseases datasets (pandemic influenza, measles, smallpox, bubonic plague, cholera, foot-and-mouth disease, HIV/AIDS and Ebola) with model estimates supporting subexponential growth dynamics. The rapid decline in effective reproduction number predicted by analytical results and observed in real and synthetic datasets within three to five disease generations contrasts with the expectation of invariant reproduction number in epidemics obeying exponential growth. The generalized-growth concept also provides us a compelling argument for the unexpected extinction of certain emerging disease outbreaks during the early ascending phase. Overall, our approach promotes a more reliable and data-driven characterization of the early epidemic phase, which is important for accurate estimation of the reproduction number and prediction of disease impact.},

abstract = {Random mixing in host populations has been a convenient simplifying assumption in the study of epidemics, but neglects important differences in contact rates within and between population groups. For HIV/AIDS, the assumption of random mixing is inappropriate for epidemics that are concentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers (FSW) and their male clients (MCF), injecting drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM). To find out who transmits infection to whom and how that affects the spread and containment of infection remains a major empirical challenge in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Here we develop a technique, based on the routine sampling of infection in linked population groups (a social network of population types), which shows how an HIV/AIDS epidemic in Can Tho Province of Vietnam began in FSW, was propagated mainly by IDU, and ultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM). Calculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for the whole network, provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply from observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita rate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections occurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best reduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This analysis can be used to guide HIV/AIDS interventions using needle and syringe exchange, condom distribution and antiretroviral therapy. The method requires only routine data and could be applied to infections in other populations.},

@article{Bershteyn2013,
abstract = {Efficient planning and evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention programmes requires an understanding of what sustains the epidemic, including the mechanism by which HIV transmission keeps pace with the ageing of the infected population. Recently, more detailed population models have been developed which represent the epidemic with sufficient detail to characterize the dynamics of ongoing transmission. Here, we describe the structure and parameters of such a model, called EMOD-HIV v. 0.7. We analyse the chains of transmission that allow the HIV epidemic to propagate across age groups in this model. In order to prevent the epidemic from dying out, the virus must find younger victims faster than its extant victims age and die. The individuals who enable such transmission events in EMOD-HIV v. 0.7 are higher concurrency, co-infected males aged 26-29 and females aged 23-24. Prevention programmes that target these populations could efficiently interrupt the mechanisms that allow HIV to transmit at a pace that is faster than the progress of time. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

@article{Anderson1992,
abstract = {A mathematical model of the transmission of HIV-1 within heterosexual populations in sub-Saharan Africa is described and its properties analysed. The model incorporates epidemiological and demographic processes and extends previous work in this area via the inclusion of age and sex dependency in rates of sexual partner change, and sexual partner choice dependent on age. Parameter assignments are made on the basis of current data on the transmission dynamics of HIV-1 and the demography of human populations in Africa. Both age-dependent rates of sexual activity and the sexual contact of males with females younger than themselves act to enhance the predicted demographic impact. With realistic parameter values, the model suggests AIDS is able to reverse the sign of population growth rates from positive to negative values over a timescale of a few decades. The sensitivity of this prediction is examined in relation to changes in the pattern of sexual contact between different age classes of females and males, different patterns of change in the age-dependent rate of sexual partner change, different assumptions concerning the doubling time of the epidemic in its early stages, and the relative efficiencies of viral transmission between men and women, and vice versa. The paper includes an assessment of the influence of the timing of changes in sexual behaviour, or the promotion of the use of condoms, on the predicted course of the epidemic. It concludes with a discussion of data needs and the model refinements required to more accurately mirror current understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-1. -from Authors},

@article{Wawer2005a,
abstract = {Background. We estimated rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission per coital act in HIV-discordant couples by stage of infection in the index partner. Methods. We retrospectively identified 235 monogamous, HIV-discordant couples in a Ugandan population-based cohort. HIV transmission within pairs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Rates of transmission per coital act were estimated by the index partner's stage of infection (recent seroconversion or prevalent or late-stage infection). The adjusted rate ratio of transmission per coital act was estimated by multivariate Poisson regression. Results. The average rate of HIV transmission was 0.0082/coital act (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.0039-0.0150) within â¼2.5 months after seroconversion of the index partner; 0.0015/coital act within 6-15 months after seroconversion of the index partner (95{\%} CI, 0.0002-0.0055); 0.0007/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0005-0.0010) among HIV-prevalent index partners; and 0.0028/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0015-0.0041) 6-25 months before the death of the index partner. In adjusted models, early- and late-stage infection, higher HIV load, genital ulcer disease, and younger age of the index partner were significantly associated with higher rates of transmission. Conclusions. The rate of HIV transmission per coital act was highest during early-stage infection. This has implications for HIV prevention and for projecting the effects of antiretroviral treatment on HIV transmission. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

More sophisticated shape features could better indicate health status.The objectives were to predict DXA total and regional body composition, serum lipid and diabetes markers, and functional strength from 3DO body scans using statistical shape modeling. Healthy adults underwent whole-body 3DO and DXA scans, blood tests, and strength assessments in the Shape Up! Adults cross-sectional observational study. Principal component analysis was performed on registered 3DO scans. Stepwise linear regressions were performed to estimate body composition, serum biomarkers, and strength using 3DO principal components (PCs). 3DO model accuracy was compared with simple anthropometric models and precision was compared with DXA.This analysis included 407 subjects. Eleven PCs for each sex captured 95\% of body shape variance. 3DO body composition accuracy to DXA was: fat mass R2Â =Â 0.88 male, 0.93 female; visceral fat mass R2Â =Â 0.67 male, 0.75 female. 3DO body fat test-retest precision was: root mean squared error Â =Â 0.81 kg male, 0.66 kg female. 3DO visceral fat was as precise (\%CV = 7.4 for males, 6.8 for females) as DXA (\%CV = 6.8 for males, 7.4 for females). Multiple 3DO PCs were significantly correlated with serum HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR, independent of simple anthropometrics. 3DO PCs improved prediction of isometric knee strength (combined model R2Â =Â 0.67 male, 0.59 female; anthropometrics-only model R2Â =Â 0.34 male, 0.24 female).3DO body shape PCs predict body composition with good accuracy and precision comparable to existing methods. 3DO PCs improve prediction of serum lipid and diabetes markers, and functional strength measurements. The safety and accessibility of 3DO scanning make it appropriate for monitoring individual body composition, and metabolic health and functional strength in epidemiological settings.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03637855.}",
